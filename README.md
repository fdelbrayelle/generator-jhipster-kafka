> JHipster module, A JHipster module to generate Apache Kafka consumers and producers.

# Introduction

This is a [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) module, that is meant to be used in a JHipster application.

# Prerequisites

As this is a [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) module, we expect you have JHipster and its related tools already installed:

- [Installing JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/installation/)

# Installation

## With NPM

To install this module:

```bash
npm install -g generator-jhipster-kafka
```

To update this module:

```bash
npm update -g generator-jhipster-kafka
```

## With Yarn

To install this module:

```bash
yarn global add generator-jhipster-kafka
```

To update this module:

```bash
yarn global upgrade generator-jhipster-kafka
```

# Usage

This describes how to use basically this module with a JHipster generated project:

1. Create a JHipster project in a new folder: `mkdir myproject && jhipster`
2. Choose `Asynchronous messages using Apache Kafka` in server side options when answering the following question : "Which other technologies would you like to use?"
3. Go to the `generator-jhipster-kafka` project folder and run `npm link`
4. Go back to your JHipster project and run `npm link generator-jhipster-kafka`
5. In the same folder, then run `yo jhipster-kafka`
6. You can choose to add a consumer and/or a producer for an given entity name (identified by its domain class name in the package `domain` of your JHipster application, where entities are generated by `jhipster entity` or JDL Studio based file through `jhipster import-jdl file_name.jh`)

You can then use your entity producer (for instance: `OrderProducer.java`) in other layers like controllers or even better service by instancing it and using its `send` method.

Generated consumers should not be explicitly used in other classes as each of them is running in a thread listening to the incoming messages.

🚀 [AKHQ (previously known as KafkaHQ)](https://github.com/tchiotludo/akhq) can be used following those steps in the root directory:

1. Run `docker-compose -f src/main/docker/kafka.yml -f src/main/docker/akhq.yml up -d` to launch the ZooKeeper and Kafka services with AKHQ
1. Go to [http://localhost:11817](http://localhost:11817)
1. Start your application with `./mvnw` to manage your topics and more!
