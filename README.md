# Kafka for JHipster

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][github-actions-image]][github-actions-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url]

> A JHipster module that generates Apache Kafka consumers and producers and more!

### 🚦 Done !

- [x] Basic [Consumer/Producer API use](#consumer-producer-api)
- [x] Several [prompt options](#prompt-options-tree) (`polling.timeout`, `auto.offset.reset.policy`)
- [x] [AKHQ (KafkaHQ)](#akhq) support

### 🛠 To do or doing...

You can have more details about work in progress or to come in [issues](https://github.com/fdelbrayelle/generator-jhipster-kafka/issues):

- [ ] Topic management
- [ ] Producer API (ordered messages, high throughput...)
- [ ] Deserialization alternatives (JacksonSerde) as a prompt option
- [ ] Security (SSL protocol as a prompt option, safe mode...)
- [ ] JHipster entity sub-generator hook
- [ ] JHipster microservices applications support
- [ ] Schema Registry and Avro support
- [ ] Kafka Connect support
- [ ] Kafka Streams support

# Introduction

This is a [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) module, that is meant to be used in a JHipster application. You can use it to generate Apache Kafka consumers and producers in a JHipster backend (Spring Boot / Java only supported at the moment). It uses Apache Kafka client as a base.

![Kafka module for JHipster in action!](images/yo-jhipster-kafka.png 'Kafka module for JHipster in action!')

# Prerequisites

As this is a [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) module, we expect you have JHipster and its related tools already installed:

- [Installing JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/installation/)

Or just run:

```bash
npm i -g generator-jhipster
```

# Installation

## With NPM

To install this module and Yeoman (`yo`):

```bash
npm install -g generator-jhipster-kafka yo
```

To update this module:

```bash
npm update -g generator-jhipster-kafka
```

## With Yarn

To install this module and Yeoman (`yo`):

```bash
yarn global add generator-jhipster-kafka yo
```

To update this module:

```bash
yarn global upgrade generator-jhipster-kafka
```

# Usage

This describes how to use basically this module with a JHipster generated project.

## Link local projects

If you want to use local versions of JHipster and the Kafka module:

1. Go to your `generator-jhipster` project folder and run `npm link`
2. Go to your `generator-jhipster-kafka` project folder and run `npm link`
3. In your project generated with JHipster run `npm link generator-jhipster generator-jhipster-kafka`

⚠️ If you delete `generator-jhipster` or `generator-jhipster-kafka` folder, you will have to repeat the previous steps.

## Basic usage

**Important :** The following steps and use cases are to be done **on a single generated JHipster monolithic application**.

📅 In a near future it will be achievable between two or more monolithic applications or in microservices.

1. Ensure you have a JHipster version > 6.0.0 with: `jhipster --version`
2. Create a JHipster project in a new folder: `mkdir myproject && cd myproject && jhipster` (you can also create a backend project only with `jhipster --skip-client`)
3. Choose `Asynchronous messages using Apache Kafka` in server side options when answering the following question : "Which other technologies would you like to use?"
4. In the same folder, then run `yo jhipster-kafka` and then follow the use case you need
5. After the generation have been done, run Kafka with: `docker-compose -f src/main/docker/kafka.yml up -d`
6. Run your application with: `./mvnw`

# Use cases

## Consumer/Producer API

The **topic naming convention** has been set to: `message_type.application_name.entity_name` (all in snake_case, it can be changed of course):

- message_type: queuing, logging, tracking, etl/db, streaming, push, user...
- application_name: the application base name
- entity_name: the entity name (or the prefix if no entity) which is consumed

### Big Bang Mode

The Big Bang Mode allows the user to rewrite from scratch all the Kafka configuration (Java files and `application.yml`) to generate new components.

### Incremental Mode

The Incremental Mode allows the user to write new Kafka configuration (new Java files and `application.yml` updates) to generate new components over previous configuration. In this mode prompt options are asked and there is a loop for these questions.

### Create a consumer linked to an entity

After following the first 3 steps of the [basic usage](#basic-usage) above:

#### Big Bang Mode

1. Create a new entity if not already generated with: `jhipster entity Foo`
2. In the same folder, run `yo jhipster-kafka`
3. "Which type of generation do you want?" - Big Bang Mode (build a configuration from scratch)
4. "Which components would you like to generate?" - Consumer
5. "For which entity (class name)?" - Foo (the available entities are retrieved in the `.jhipster` folder as `.json`)
6. "What is the consumer polling timeout (in ms)?" - Your answer or '10000' by default (global for all consumers)
7. "Define the auto offset reset policy?" - Your answer or 'earliest' by default (global for all consumers)
8. Overwrite all files in conflict
9. `FooConsumer` (consumes `Foo`) is available with a `FooDeserializer`

#### Incremental Mode

1. Create a new entity if not already generated with: `jhipster entity Foo`
2. In the same folder, run `yo jhipster-kafka`
3. "Which type of generation do you want?" - Incremental Mode (upgrade an existing configuration)
4. "For which entity (class name)?" - Foo (the available entities are retrieved in the `.jhipster` folder as `.json`)
5. "Which components would you like to generate?" - Consumer
6. "What is the consumer polling timeout (in ms)?" - Your answer or '10000' by default (global for all consumers)
7. "Define the auto offset reset policy?" - Your answer or 'earliest' by default (global for all consumers)
8. "Do you want to continue adding consumers or producers?" - Your answer or 'N' par default
9. Overwrite all files in conflict
10. `FooConsumer` (consumes `Foo`) is available with a `FooDeserializer`

### Create a producer linked to an entity

#### Big Bang Mode

1. Create a new entity if not already generated with: `jhipster entity Foo`

4. "Which components would you like to generate?" - Producer
5. "For which entity (class name)?" - Foo (the available entities are retrieved in the `.jhipster` folder as `.json`)
6. Overwrite all files in conflict
7. `FooProducer` (produces `Foo`) is available with a `FooSerializer` and a `FooKafkaResource` to [help testing](#test-consumers-and-producers)

#### Incremental Mode

1. Create a new entity if not already generated with: `jhipster entity Foo`
2. In the same folder, run `yo jhipster-kafka`

```

## Skip prompts

You can use `yo jhipster-kafka --skip-prompts` to use the default prompts values to generate:

- a minimal `kafka` configuration in `application.yml` files with only a `bootstrap.servers`
- a `akhq.yml` docker-compose file to run AKHQ (see below)
- a `GenericConsumer.java` that you extend to create your own consumers

## Test consumers and producers

You can use your producer (`*Producer.java`) in other layers like resources or services by instancing it and using its `send` method (which is asynchronous).

By default a `*KafkaResource.java` is also generated with the producer. It has an endpoint to call the generated producer. Supposing you have generated consumers and producers for an existing `Foo` JHIpster entity (with a String field `foo`) and for no entity (`Bar` prefix), you can test it that way with `curl` and `jq`:

```
token=`curl -X POST localhost:8080/api/authenticate -d '{ "username": "admin", "password": "admin" }' -H "Content-Type: application/json"|jq -r '.id_token'`

# For a producer linked to an entity (Foo as JSON):
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "foo": "foo" }' -X POST localhost:8080/api/foos/kafka

# For a producer not linked to an entity (String):
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d 'bar' -X POST localhost:8080/api/bars/kafka
```

Generated consumers should not be explicitly used in other classes as each of them is running in a thread listening to the incoming messages. However, messages sent through the generated producer will be read if an associated consumer has been generated as well. You just have to read the logs of `./mvnw` locally.

## AKHQ

🚀 [AKHQ (previously known as KafkaHQ)](https://github.com/tchiotludo/akhq) can be used following those steps in the root directory:

1. Run `docker-compose -f src/main/docker/kafka.yml -f src/main/docker/akhq.yml up -d` to launch the ZooKeeper and Kafka services with AKHQ
1. Go to [http://localhost:11817](http://localhost:11817)
1. Start your application with `./mvnw` to manage your topics and more!

# Contribution

If you want to contribute to the module, please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

In addition, here are some things to know before to dive into:

- JavaScript ES6 is used for the generator and Java for the generated files
- The module is a Yeoman generator (the module is a sub-generator of JHipster which is itself a Yeoman-based generator)
- Module tests are done with [mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [yeoman-assert and yeoman-test](https://yeoman.io/authoring/testing.html). You can run them with `npm test`
- Format rules are defined in `.eslintrc` and `.prettierrc`
- `generators/app/index.js` is the main entrypoint, it uses `prompts.js` and `files.js`
- `generators/app/prompts.js` is used to manage prompts options
- `generators/app/files.js` is used to write files to the generated project
- `generators/app/templates` contains [ejs](https://ejs.co) templates (`.ejs`) used to generate files
